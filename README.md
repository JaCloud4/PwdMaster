Okay, so my 1st web branch is ready to be the master branch

In first Master branch I was able to:
Create packages and methods that allow for accurate ingestion, creation, and validating of I/O associate with creating passwords
Work on my Git skills
Create logic for PwdMaster app
Test and run app from terminal successfully
fix bugs in logic
Create Http routing for services
A lot of debugging and fixing of local, global, IDE, and system variables.

In this web branch I was able to:
Successfully create first draft, connect the routing to html page
Create POST and GET methods to update the html page using MUX and Hugo
lots of validations and error logging

Next:
Will move web branch to both Master and feature branch and pick up from feature branch to add more logic such as:
Choosing of more criteria or specific passwords other than length
test and validate these features then punch to web branch for further web development, enhancements, and functionality
Will try to write simple notes here and there
